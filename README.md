## Bruna Bites UX/UI Portfolio

Hey, there! This is my personal portfolio built using 
[gridsome-forestry-starter](https://github.com/itsnwa/gridsome-forestry-starter) remixed, [Forestry](https://forestry.io) as CMS, [Netlify](netlify.com) for deployment.


### Want to use?

Feel free to check things, remix and serve as you want. But have in mind that all content, color schemes, and images are my property.

--------------

Development
# install Gridsome globally
npm install --global @gridsome/cli

# cd into the project directory
cd gridsome-forestry-starter

# install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run develop
Forestry (Content Management)
This project has been pre-configured to work with Forestry, just import your repository âœ¨
Any changes you make will be commited back to the repo, and deployed if you're using Netlify.

Import this project into Forestry

Deploy with Netlify
Import your site in Netlify

Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.
Set the build command to: gridsome build
Set the publish directory to: dist
That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on git push or when saving documents from Forestry.
