      <div class="about-me">
        
        <p>My name is Bruna and since 2004 I've been working either as art director or designer in different places. Ad agencies, big companies like Newell Brands and Banco do Brasil, startups or even my own studio.</p>

        <p>In my past life, I've worked with graphic design, but at some point I got into the Digital Industry, where I've been for the past 12 years.</p>

        <p>Right now I'm a UX Specialist at Capgemini inside Banco do Brasil, the biggest and oldest bank in Brazil, delivering relevant financial services to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

        <p>A phrase that defines me is "Ask Bruna. She knows it". Yeap, I'm curious and I keep learning things so I can share with others. A colleague once described me as "a live rss feed".</p>

        <p>Aggregator, Connected, Detail-oriented, Insightful, Self taught, Creative, Leader. Those are just a few terms that begin to describe me as a professional (and human being).</p>

        <p>I'm looking forward to help (remotely, by now) a solid company or a novice startup creating amazing digital services and products with a strategic approach. Feel free to contact me if want to know more about my skills or take a look at my Lindkedin profile. ;) My expertise covers Design (UI / UX / Visual) and Digital Art Direction and I can create some stuff using Html, CSS, Javascript and Github (like this portfolio).</p>

        <blockquote>I do believe that design make things and people better. And that makes me want to help makers and companies to build and design solutions based on people.</blockquote>

        <p>üë©‚Äçüíª I'm avaiable for projects! Get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@brunabites.com">hello@brunabites.com</a></p>
