      <div class="about-me">
        <p>
          My name is Bruna and since 2004 I've been working either as an art
          director or designer in different places. Ad agencies, big companies
          like Newell Brands and Banco do Brasil, startups, or even my 
          studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my past life, I've worked with graphic design, but at some point, I
          got into the Digital Industry, where I've been for the past 12 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now I'm a Sr Product Designer at Pipefy, where I'm in charge of
          improving all messaging core features experience, by conducting
          interviews, data analysis, and designing user interfaces.
          I'm also part of the Design Ops initiative.
        </p>

        <p>
          A phrase that defines me is "Ask Bruna. She knows it". Yeap, I'm
          curious and I keep learning things so I can share them with others. A
          colleague once described me as "a live RSS feed".
        </p>

        <p>
          Aggregator, Connected, Detail-oriented, Insightful, Self-taught,
          Creative, Leader. Those are just a few terms that begin to describe me
          as a professional (and human being).
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Product Designer, I hope to help a design-driven company or a
          novice startup create impressive digital services and products
          with a strategic approach. Contact me if you want to know more
          about my skills or visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunabites/"
          target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>. My expertise covers Design (UI / UX / Visual)
          and Digital Art Direction. I can create some stuff using Html, CSS,
          Javascript, and Github (like this portfolio).
        </p>

        <blockquote>
           I believe design makes life easier by simplifying complicated things.
           And that makes me want to help makers and companies to build and
           design solutions based on people.
        </blockquote>
